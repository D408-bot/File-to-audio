# File-to-audio
**WARNING: Don't try opening the audio files that you get, because your pc might crash and don't encode files larger than 1MB. This is not for storing your files, but a fun proof of concept.**

# How to use
First, clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/D408-bot/File-to-audio.git
```

To run, use the following command
```bash
python3 Encode.py <YOUR_FILE>
```
or
```bash
python Encode.py <YOUR_FILE>
```

Same as for the decode
